        <h1>Anime</h1>
        <h2>Bleach</h2>

        This is my very first website and I'm <b>extremely excited!!!</b>

        
            <p>It has been eight years since ‘Bleach’ finished airing. The ending left viewers feeling let down and upset.
                 Bleach is one of the <u>‘Big Three’ animes’</u> so why was the series cut short when the manga continued? There was no 
                 official reason given as to why this famous anime was cancelled. Fans speculated that it was because of a drop in 
                 popularity. But for those that loved the series. The eight-year wait is over. Because a new and final season is 
                 airing this year. The hopeless and inconclusive ending will no longer taint the otherwise amazing show. 
                 But what can you expect from the final arc?The basic plot of Bleach follows the story of a headstrong teenager named 
                 Ichico Kurosaki. After meeting a strangely dressed woman, he obtains ‘soul reaper’ abilities. The anime goes through 
                 several arcs of developing his ability and the ability of his friends as they try to save the world from various forms of 
                 evil.The new season will have hundreds of Manga chapters to cover and, as such, there will be a lot of ground to cover.
                  It is estimated that there will be about sixty to eighty episodes. Which should cover the multitude of chapters 
                  that anime fans have yet to discover. Thankfully, the new arc is set to pick up from where it ended eight years ago. 
                 So what will ‘The Thousand Year Blood War’ cover? For those that do not want spoilers or to be surprised by the 
                 theme and story. Avert your eyes.The plot will focus on the anarchy surrounding the disappearance of Ichigo Hollow. The soul society has been invaded 
                 by a secret group known as the Wandenreich. A war is declared between the Quincys and Shinigami . 
                 The disappearance of Ichigo is explained by the training that was undergone to fight this secret group and in 
                 turn save the soul society. All of the plot points are said to answer all the questions that were abruptly left unanswered
                  by the final season in 2021.</p><br>
                  <h3>Character Bios</h3><br>
                  Learning about the characters before watching an anime is always a good thing. I personally enjoy seeing what the main characters are like before I watch an anime. It gives me a feel for whether or not the art style is appealing to my eye. But, of course, the art style is not everything when it comes to enjoying an anime. Sometimes <br>
                  
                  <b>Ichigo Kurosaki</b><br>
                  
                  Ichigo is a 15-year-old boy just trying to get through school. When a new power is thrust upon him, 
                  he must now navigate his everyday life while having the responsibilities that come with his new-found soul 
                  reaper power. As far as his personality goes, Ichigo is a short-tempered, determined, strong-willed and impulsive person.
                   He fights for what he believes in with all he has and will do anything to save his friends. <br>
                  
                   <i>Uryuu Ishida</i><br>
                 
                  Uryuu is a ‘frenemy’ of Ichigo, as the last surviving Quincy, his heritage demands that he fight the soul reapers. 
                  But he becomes friends with the headstrong Ichigo and eventually calls him friend. Uryuu is a quiet and contemplative 
                  person, he tends to favour strategy over action. He tries a little too hard to be cool to the point that it hinders
                   his movement. For example, the clothing he chooses tends to be impractical, but he likes the way it makes him feel.<br>
                  
                  <b>Orihime Inoue</b><br>
                 
                  Orihime is the ditsy, cute love interest of Ichigo and almost every other male in her friendship group. 
                  She is a friendly, funny and kind person, always wanting to do right by her friends and family. Despite her ditsy
                   nature, Orihime has proved that she is quite perceptive. Especially when it comes to Ichigo. <br>
                  
                   <i>Sado Yasutora</i><br>
                  
                  Sado is mainly known as Chad within the friends group. He is of Mexican descent and appears to be something of a 
                  delinquent despite his calm and quiet nature. He is the best friend of Ichigo Kurosaki and has been inseparable 
                  ever since an incident involving a beat down from some bullies. Although Chad is tall and strong, he never fights 
                  back unless necessary. He prefers not to fight unless there is no other choice. <br>
                  
                  <b>Rukia Kuchiki</b><br>
                  
                  Rukia is a member of the 13th Division in the Soul Society’s Shinigami. Her job as a soul reaper is to eliminate
                   ‘Hollows’ or lost souls and to help the dead move on to the Soul Society when they are ready. Rukia is a bit 
                   of a tomboy and a tough nut to crack. But she is loyal to her friends and to her duty, making her quite an
                    unmovable force. <br>
